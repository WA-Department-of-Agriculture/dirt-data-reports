***Soil Texture*** is the relative proportion of sand, silt, and clay-sized
particles in your soil. Imagine these particles like basketballs, golf balls,
and poppy seeds, which are very different in size even though soil particles
don't appear different to the naked eye. Importantly, soil texture describes
only the mineral portion of the soil and is not affected by organic matter or
management. However, soil texture is a significant driver of how soils respond
to management. Soils with higher clay content can hold more nutrients, organic
matter, and water than sandy soils. This is because clay particles have high
surface area and electrical charge and create small soil pores. Soils with high
sand content have larger pores, and cannot hold as much water.
