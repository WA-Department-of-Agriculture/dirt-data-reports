***Potentially Mineralizable Nitrogen*** (PMN) represents the amount of organic
nitrogen that can be converted (or "mineralized") to plant-available nitrate or
ammonium. This measurement is taken from a laboratory incubation and can help
producers estimate how much nitrogen may be released to crops during the growing
season. Additional information on the measurement and interpretation of PMN can
be found in this [publication from the NRCS](https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/sites/default/files/2022-10/potentially_mineralizable_nitrogen.pdf).
