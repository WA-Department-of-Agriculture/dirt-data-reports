***Soil Organic Matter*** (SOM) is the portion of soils not made up of minerals,
air, and water, but is instead composed of animal, plant, and microbial matter
in various stages of decomposition. SOM is comprised of approximately 58%
organic carbon (to convert total organic carbon (TOC) to SOM, an easy rule of
thumb is to simply multiply by 2). The remaining portion of SOM includes other
essential plant nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorous, and sulfur. SOM varies
by inherent soil and landscape properties such as texture, mineralogy,
precipitation, and temperature. It is also greatly impacted by management. To
learn more about how to increase SOM, read about the [NRCS principles of
building soil
health](https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/conservation-basics/natural-resource-concerns/soils/soil-health "NRCS principles of building soil health").
SOM underlies many of the benefits and ecosystem services that soils provide. It
has a large impact on almost all other soil properties and is often used as a
primary indicator of soil health. However, SOM can be slow to change as the
result of management. Because of this, many other indicators have been developed
to detect more sensitive components within SOM. Keep reading to learn more.
