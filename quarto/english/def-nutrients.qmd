***Plant Essential Nutrients*** include both macronutrients such as nitrogen
(N), phosphorous (P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), and sulfur
(S), and micronutrients (required in comparatively smaller amounts) such as iron
(Fe), zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), boron (B), and manganese (Mn). These elements are
typically reported in parts per million, which is equivalent to milligrams per
kilogram (1 ppm = 1 mg/kg). Each of these elements are required for crop
production, though the 4 Rs---or the right quantity, right timing, right
placement, and right source---will vary depending on the crop. While many
of these nutrients are inherent in the soil, some must be added. Careful
consideration should be given to balancing and replenishing plant essential
nutrients via soil health building practices and principles. More information on
plant essential nutrients can be found in this [Oregon State University Soil Test Interpretation Guide](https://catalog.extension.oregonstate.edu/ec1478 "Oregon State University Soil Test Interpretation Guide").
