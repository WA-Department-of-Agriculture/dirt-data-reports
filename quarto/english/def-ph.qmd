***Soil pH*** describes how acidic (pH less than 7.0) or alkaline (pH greater
than 7.0) the soil is, and is a measure of the concentration of hydrogen ions in
the soil solution. Many essential nutrients like phosphorous (P), iron (Fe),
manganese (Mn), zinc (Zn), copper, (Cu), cobalt (Co), and boron (B) become less
plant-available at alkaline pHs. Other nutrients like aluminum (Al) or B can
become toxic at acidic pHs. Soil pH also greatly affects what microbial
populations can live in the soil. Soil pH is impacted by inherent qualities of
the soil such as its age, mineralogy, and rainfall zone. It is also impacted by
fertilization, irrigation water pH, and SOM content. Most agricultural crops
grow best in neutral soil pHs, within a range of 6 to 8. Soil pH can be lowered
using sulfur or raised by adding agricultural lime.
