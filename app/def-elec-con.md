***Electrical Conductivity*** (EC) measures the concentration of salts in the
soil. Excessive salts can stress plants and lower crop yield and quality, as
well as impact soil structure, infiltration rates, and water holding capacity.
In particular, sodium (Na) can cause crusting and dispersion of soil particles,
leading to surface runoff and erosion. Crops in sodium-affected soils (sodic
soils) may also have challenges taking up other essential salts such as Ca, Mg,
and K.
