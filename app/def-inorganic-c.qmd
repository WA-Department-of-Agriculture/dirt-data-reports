***Inorganic Carbon***, frequently called carbonates, is present in some soils,
mostly in arid environments. Carbonates can be an important source of nutrients
and carbon storage in soils, but in excess can lead to challenges with salinity
and poor infiltration. While some strategies can be employed to increase or
decrease carbonates in soil, they are generally considered less sensitive to
management than organic C. As such, most discussions of agricultural management
focus only on organic C.
