***Infiltration*** measures the rate at which water enters the soil surface. If
the infiltration rate is low, water will pond on the surface. This can make it
difficult to enter the field and lead to erosion and runoff. High salinity, plow
pans, and cemented layers in the soil can lead to poor infiltration and
drainage. Soil texture is also a major factor, as large pores created by sand
particles quicken infiltration rates while small pores from clay particles slow
infiltration rates. Management also plays a role. Excessive tillage can break up
soil structure which slows infiltration. Adding organic matter can form soil
aggregates, which can quicken infiltration. This indicator is typically measured
in the field, as outlined in this [NRCS
protocol](https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/sites/default/files/2022-10/Infiltration.pdf "NRCS infiltration protocol").
