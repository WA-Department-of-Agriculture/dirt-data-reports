***Water Holding Capacity*** (WHC) is the amount of water a soil can hold. WHC
describes how the soil will store and supply water during high rainfall events
and times of drought. WHC varies by soil texture and bulk density, and can be
greatly impacted by management. Generally, soils with finer textures, high
organic matter, and low bulk density have higher WHC.
