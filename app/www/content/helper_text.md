## **Step 1. Download Template**

Choose which language the report will be in. Download the Excel template and **replace the example data [hyperlink to below modal content]** in the two tabs with your own.

**Modal content:**

Modal title: Template Tabs

**"Data" Tab:** Columns **A** (**`year`**) through **J** (**`latitude`**) contain sample metadata. Columns with **bold headers** are required and cannot have any missing values. Do not delete any of these metadata columns. Replace all columns after **J** with your measurement results.

**"Data Dictionary" Tab:** Each measurement in the "**Data**" **Tab** (column **K** (`texture`) and all columns through the end of the sheet) must also be included in this dictionary tab. 

-   **`measurement_group`:** how the measurements are grouped into sections within the report

-   **`column_name`:** must match the **`Data`** tab

-   **`abbr`:** is abbreviation for the measurement shown in tables and plots

-   **`unit`:** is the measurement unit

## **Step 2. Upload Data**

Upload your completed template. Your data will automatically be checked against these [**eight data validation rules**]{.underline} **[hyperlink to about_validation.md]**. Any checks that fail will be printed below in an error message.

## **Step 3. Project Info**

Customize the report with your project-specific information. Use [basic markdown syntax](https://wa-department-of-agriculture.github.io/soils/articles/markdown.html) to italicize or bold words and insert hyperlinks. Click “**Preview**” to see how these sections will appear in the report.

**Note**: if you are building reports in Spanish, you will need to translate your **Project Summary**, **Soil Sample Depth**, and **Looking Forward** text.

**Tooltips/popover info icon next to each input:**

-   **Project Summary**: Thank the participating farmer. Consider including information related to how many samples you’ve taken, in how many crops and regions. Consider identifying members of the project team and acknowledging support from your funders and collaborators. Emphasize the objectives of the project and include links for more information.

-   **Soil Sample Depth**: The following sentence will be modified based on this input within the **Project Results** section: “All samples were collected from *[SOIL DEPTH (e.g. 0-6 inches, or 0-30 cm)]*.”

-   **Include Measurement Definitions**: Choose which measurements were included in your soil sampling project.

-   **Looking Forward**: Consider describing how this data will be used. Are you building decision support tools? Publications? Will you be speaking at upcoming field days or conferences about this work? Soils data can be confusing… let your audience know that this is just the start of the conversation! Thank participating producers once again.

## **Step 4. Build Reports**

Choose the year and up to five\* producers to build reports for. The producer_id list will automatically be updated based on the year selected. Click “**Build**” to start building the reports, which will be generated in a zip file within your Downloads folder.

*\*For the purpose of testing, we are allowing only five producers at a time to prevent timeout errors. We hope to increase this limit before the public launch of the app.*
