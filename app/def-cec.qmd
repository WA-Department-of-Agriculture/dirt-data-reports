***Cation Exchange Capacity*** (CEC) describes the soil's ability to hold a
slow-release reservoir of nutrients, as positively charged ions (e.g., NH^~4~+^,
K^+^, Ca^2+^, Mg^2+^) in the soil are held by negatively charged sites on clay
particles and SOM. While CEC is determined in part by soil texture, increasing
SOM can greatly increase CEC. Sandy loam soils typically have CECs ranging from
1 to 10 meq/100 g, loam soils range from 5 to 15 meq/100 g, and clay soils have
CECs greater than 30 meq/100 g. SOM can provide an additional 200 to 400 meq/100
g (note that CEC units may be reported differently, but 1 meq/100g = 1
cmolc/kg). Soil pH can also alter the CEC of organic matter and clay particles,
further underscoring the impact of pH on other soil measurements.
