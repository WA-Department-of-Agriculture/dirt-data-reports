***Total Nitrogen*** is a measurement of both inorganic (plant-available nitrate
and ammonium) and organic (typically not plant-available) nitrogen in the soil.
Having sufficient total nitrogen in the soil is key for promoting
mineralization, or the process of changing the organic nitrogen to a form that
plants can use.
