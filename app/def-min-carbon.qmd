***Potentially Mineralizable Carbon*** (MinC, frequently referred to as "Soil
Respiration") measures the release of carbon dioxide (CO₂) from soil. This
measurement is done in a laboratory incubation under controlled conditions
"ideal" for microbes. The term mineralization refers to the process in which
soil microbes produce CO₂ as they decompose SOM and plant residues. This process
also releases other nutrients, like nitrogen, which can be taken up by crops.
Higher MinC represents greater potential biological activity. Soils with lower
SOM will have inherently lower MinC, while compacted soils may not provide
adequate aeration for the mineralization process.
