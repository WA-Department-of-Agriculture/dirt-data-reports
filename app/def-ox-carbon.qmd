***Permanganate Oxidizable Carbon*** (POXC, once referred to as "Active Carbon")
is a fraction of SOM that is more quickly influenced by changes in management
(compared to SOM, which can take up to ten years to detect a difference). In
this laboratory test, a portion of SOM is decomposed or oxidized by potassium
permanganate. POXC levels are often associated with practices that lead to
long-term organic matter storage, and may represent a portion of SOM that is
from plant material, including compounds related to plant defense.
