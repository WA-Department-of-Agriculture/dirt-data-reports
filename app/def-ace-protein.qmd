***ACE Soil Protein*** is the fraction of SOM comprised of proteins from soil
microorganisms. Proteins contain nitrogen that can be mineralized for plant
uptake, and are therefore an important contributor to crop growth. ACE stands
for autoclaved citrate-extractable, which is the laboratory method for
extracting the proteins. ACE soil protein is related to aggregate stability as
it partly measures proteins that are physically sticky and hold soil particles
together. ACE is also sensitive to management changes, so can be a valuable
indicator for evaluating relatively short-term changes in soil health.
