***Aggregate Stability*** measures the resistance of groups of soil particles,
or aggregates, to disintegration. Aggregates are formed when soil particles
associate with organic matter, plant roots, fungal hyphae, and "glues" made by
soil microorganisms. Water and wind can break down unstable aggregates, while
stable aggregates can reduce erosion and increase water infiltration, drainage,
and storage capacity. Aggregate stability is an excellent example of how
biological life impacts soil physical properties. Soils high in clay tend to
have higher aggregate stability than sandy soils, but increasing soil organic
matter improves aggregate stability across all soil textures.ate stability,
while inherently high sand content reduces aggregate stability.
