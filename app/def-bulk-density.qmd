***Bulk Density*** is the mass of particles within a certain volume of soil and
is used as an indicator of soil compaction. Bulk density varies depending on
soil texture and structure and is greatly affected by tillage, tractor passes,
and organic matter inputs. It is a primary determinant of soil aeration,
porosity, water infiltration, and root growth. For more information on the
special equipment required to measure bulk density, consult this [NRCS
protocol](https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/sites/default/files/2022-10/Soil%20Bulk%20Density%20Moisture%20Aeration.pdf "NRCS bulk density protocol").
